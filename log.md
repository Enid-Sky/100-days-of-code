# 100 Days Of Code  - Log :computer:


###  :calendar:Day 1: May 6th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I read documentation on Node and Express. Then I setup my first local server by installing node, express, body-parser and cors. I also learned about the file heirarchy. 

**Thoughts** Surprisingly easier that I thought it would be. However, there is much more ahead.

<p>:star2: Wedding Site Landing Page Project: <a href='https://github.com/Enid-Sky/LandingPageWeddingSite'>HERE</a>. This project features a multi-section landing page with a dynamically updating navigation menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. It is clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page. When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.</p>
