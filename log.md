# 100 Days Of Code  - Log :computer:

###  :calendar:Day 8: May 12th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** 
<p>:arrow_right: Spent the day finishing up my local server test site using NodeJS, Express, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal was to set up GET and POST routes and to understand the way an API works in the client-server model. I set up a test API on my server. So the information is coming from the object I set up. The user can type in their favorite animal fact and the the data will be pushed to the allAnimalData object I set up. Then the API data and user data is displayed on the screen. I addes some very simple css to make it a little more visually appealing. </p>

**Thoughts:** 
<p>:thought_balloon: The server project was great practice. Next I need to build a project using a real API. The weather app is up next. </p>

###  :calendar:Day 5-7: May 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** 
<p>:arrow_right: Working on putting together a simple app that let's you add the name of your favorite animal, and a fact. Then returns an array of facts. Using a fake API, basically to understand functionality. </p>

###  :calendar:Day 4: May 9th, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** 
<p>:arrow_right: Continued working through Client & Server side lessons on Udacity. </p>
<p>:arrow_right: Practiced Async JavaScript with promises. </p>


**Thoughts:** 
<p>:thought_balloon:  I'm hoping to put the async JavaScript I learned today into practice when I build my next project (A Weather App). </p>
<p>:thought_balloon:  Heard back from my mentor today, my GET and POST routes are correct but I was pointing to the wrong folder. Will watch that for next time. </p>

**Thoughts:** 

<p>I need to continue working on javascript so that it stays fresh in my mind. So happy to have found extra resources regarding Node Express. </p>

###  :calendar:Day 1: May 6th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** 
<p>:arrow_right:I read documentation on Node and Express. Then I setup my first local server by installing node, express, body-parser and cors. I also learned about the file heirarchy. <p>

**Thoughts:** Surprisingly easier that I thought it would be. However, there is much more ahead.
