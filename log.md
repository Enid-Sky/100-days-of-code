# 100 Days Of Code  - Log :computer:


### Day 1: May 6th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Link(s) to work**

**Until now**: I've been coding just about everyday for sometime now, so I'm joining this challenge to keep track of my progress, consistently commit my projects to GitHub and be part of this awesome community :smile:.
